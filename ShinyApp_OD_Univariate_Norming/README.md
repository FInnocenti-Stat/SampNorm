This repository contains a R/Shiny app to obtain sample sizes for optimal design for univariate regression-based norming, as described in Innocenti et al. (2023, Psychological Methods, 28(1), 89–106. https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000394)

To run the code you would need:
1. An installation of R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
2. With a shiny library (install.packages("shiny")).
3. Then run this code:

   shiny::runGitHub('FInnocenti-Stat/ShinyApp_OD_Univariate_Norming')

Alternatively, you can access the Shiny app directly—without installing R or downloading the source files—using the following link: https://francescoinnocenti.shinyapps.io/shinyapp_od_univariate_norming/
