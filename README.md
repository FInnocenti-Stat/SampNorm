This repository contains a R/Shiny app to obtain sample sizes for the optimal design for multivariate norming with the Mahalanobis distance, as in Innocenti et al. (2023, JEBS)

To run the code you would need

An installation of R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
with a shiny library (install.packages("shiny")).
then run this code:
shiny::runGitHub('FInnocenti-Stat/ShinyApp_SampSize_MahalaDist')
