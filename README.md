# ShinyApp_RE_subODesigns
This repository contains a R/Shiny app to compute the relative efficiency and the required sample size increase for a sub-optimal design versus the optimal design given a model for test norming

To run the code you would need:

1. An installation of R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
2. With a shiny library (install.packages("shiny")).
3. then run this code:
shiny::runGitHub('FInnocenti-Stat/ShinyApp_RE_subODesigns')

Alternatively, you can access the Shiny app directly—without installing R or downloading the source files—using the following link: https://francescoinnocenti.shinyapps.io/shinyapp_re_subodesigns/
