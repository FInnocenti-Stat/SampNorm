This repository contains a R/Shiny app to obtain sample sizes for the optimal design for multivariate norming with the Mahalanobis distance, as in Innocenti et al. (2024,  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, 49(5), 817-847. https://doi.org/10.3102/10769986231210807)

To run the code you would need:

1. An installation of R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
2. With a shiny library (install.packages("shiny")).
3. then run this code:

shiny::runGitHub('FInnocenti-Stat/ShinyApp_SampSize_MahalaDist')

Alternatively, you can access the Shiny app directly—without installing R or downloading the source files—using the following link: https://francescoinnocenti.shinyapps.io/ShinyApp_SampSize_MahalaDist/
